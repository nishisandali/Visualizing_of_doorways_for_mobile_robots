# Visualizing_of_doorways_for_mobile_robots
These codes detects doorway entrances 

Visual Understanding of doorways for mobile robots will be a major tick off in the social acceptance context of robots. At the same time this helps to utilize robots in many business situations and an urge to commercialize the social robots.
The research focused upon, robots understanding “an open door” which has “a door frame” while the robot being perpendicular to the door. The overall result that emerges from the scope of the literature is positive giving us an 75% detection rate (out of the 12 samples 3 samples was not able to detect the door way). 
The research used computer vision methods such as Canny Edge Detection and Probabilistic of Hough Transform. The actual doorway pictures are converted into gray scale images using Canny Edge Detection.  The door way identification is done through Hough Transform. Inorder to communicate with the robots, Python language was used with OpenCv library and Anaconda Distribution. 
The research concluded that detection of doorways depends upon the position of the robot and the angle it’s being approached towards the doorway.
